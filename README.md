# Exoventure

An tile-based exoplanet generator experiment intended for use with a 3D 4X strategy game.

The generated planets feature tectonic plate simulation, including realistic oceanic subduction zones and mountain ranges, and a simulated climate to ultimately determine realistic biomes, realistic rain shadows, etc.
